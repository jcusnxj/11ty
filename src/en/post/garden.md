summary: First and last blog post.

I've been trying to create websites for as long as I can remember. I've always been interested in how it's done. And to be completely honest, I was also interested because of the desire to publish something. However, I never managed to create decent content, so it always remained just playing around with the technical side of things. That hasn't changed at all to this day. Only the tools change. Besides HTML itself, at the very beginning for me, it was GeoCities. I have fond memories of that time. Thanks to GeoCities, personal websites were truly personal and fun. Today, this tool is even experiencing a small [renaissance](https://neocities.org).   

When I dig myself out of the swamp of nostalgia and skip ahead a quarter of a century with a bunch of other tools, I'm currently fascinated by the world of SSG. After a brief episode with Jekyll, I stumbled upon 11ty, and it immediately became clear that I had found a new toy. Around the same time, I also came across the now-popular concept of the [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). A new label for an old thing. Or maybe it's really a new thing and I'm just an old guy. It depends on how old you are. 

But either way, this is it. This suits me. I started building my own digital garden using 11ty, a GitHub repository, and hosting on Netlify. And not to forget, using ChatGPT as well. When I don't know something, I ask AI. Plus, I use it to translate the whole website into English. The paradox is that thereâ€™s a blog here too. [The killer of everything](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/). But just like the language version, it's a byproduct of my curiosity while experimenting with 11ty. And since it took some effort, I'm not going to delete it right away. However, it's quite possible that this will be the first and last blog post.
