## Launch and Earth Orbit
The Saturn V launch vehicle with the Apollo system launches from Kennedy Space Center. First, the first stage (S-IC) and then the second stage (S-II) are separated. After approximately 12 minutes, the third stage (S-IVB) reaches a so-called parking orbit around the Earth at an altitude of about 185 km. The third stage engine shuts down, and the entire assembly orbits the Earth. Systems are checked, and the spacecraft is oriented to the correct position before the second and final burn of the third stage engine.

## TLI -Trans Lunar Injection and Coast to the Moon
A restart of the third stage (S-IVB) definitively propels the spacecraft from Earth's orbit towards the Moon (TLI - Trans Lunar Injection). After the burn (~5 minutes), the command and service module (CSM) separates from the third stage, turns in space, and begins the docking maneuver. It docks with the lunar module (LM), which is still stored in the third stage of the Saturn V rocket. Then the CSM-LM assembly separates from the third stage and continues towards the Moon on its own, controlled by onboard computers with occasional correction burns from the service module. The journey to the Moon takes about another 60 hours.

## LOI - Lunar Orbit Insertion and Descent Preparation
Upon reaching the Moon, the crew ignites the service module engine and begins a braking maneuver to enter lunar orbit (LOI - Lunar Orbit Insertion). The crew begins preparations for descent to the lunar surface. Systems are checked, and the LM is activated. The crew enters the LM, and the LM separates from the CSM. This entire phase takes several hours, during which the combined CSM-LM assembly orbits the Moon several times.

## Lunar Module Descent and Landing
The LM separates from the CSM module, ignites its engine, and begins a roughly 12-minute descent to the lunar surface, controlled by a combination of onboard computers and manual piloting by the astronauts.

## Surface Operations and Departure from the Moon
This phase varies the most among different Apollo missions. All missions, however, perform at least one EVA (Extravehicular Activity). During the EVA, they collect samples of regolith and rocks, take photographs, and set up scientific experiments. While Apollo 11 stayed on the lunar surface for about 21 hours, missions Apollo 16 and 17 stayed for over 70 hours. Unlike Apollo 11, which conducted one EVA, Apollo 15, 16, and 17 conducted three EVAs. Eventually, all missions lifted off from the Moon to reunite with the CSM, which was waiting in lunar orbit.

## TEI - Trans Earth Injection and Return Coast
After successfully rendezvousing with the CSM in lunar orbit, the LM and CSM dock. Lunar samples and other equipment are transferred from the LM to the command module. The ascent stage of the LM is jettisoned, and preparations for TEI - Trans Earth Injection begin. After properly orienting the CSM module, the service module engine ignites (~2 minutes), definitively leaving lunar orbit. The journey back to Earth begins, taking about 90 hours. At the end of this journey, the service module separates from the command module. The command module is then oriented for entry into the atmosphere, targeting a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean.
