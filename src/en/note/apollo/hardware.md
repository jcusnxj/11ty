<br><strong>Description</strong><br>
A three-stage launch vehicle used in the Apollo and Skylab programs. Designed and developed under the leadership of Wernher von Braun, who was part of the team in the German V-2 rocket program during World War II.

The first (S-IC) and second (S-II) stages separated in the first minutes after launch. The third stage (S-IVB) then carried the Apollo spacecraft into a parking orbit around the Earth at an altitude of approximately 185 km. Inside this stage was the Lunar Module, while the CSM module was attached to its tip. The final burn of the third stage (TLI - Trans Lunar Injection) sent the Apollo spacecraft definitively towards the Moon.

<br><strong>Description</strong><br>
<b>Command Module (CM)</b><br>
The command module had a conical shape with a height of 3.4 meters and a maximum diameter of 3.9 meters. It was the only part of the Apollo spacecraft equipped with a heat shield, as it was designed for re-entry into Earth's atmosphere with the crew and subsequent landing in the sea. The interior cabin contained three seats for all crew members. It separated from the Service module only in the final phase of the mission after approaching Earth.

<b>Service Module (SM)</b> 
The service module had a cylindrical shape with a length of 6.7 meters and a diameter of 3.6 meters. It was divided into six sections, which contained tanks for oxidizer, fuel, space for fuel cells, and tanks for oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. The service module's engine was responsible for all critical maneuvers, such as for instance entering lunar orbit (LOI - Lunar Orbit Insertion) or leaving it.
